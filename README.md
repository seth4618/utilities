utility scripts and such

## Github API

- [unsubgithub](./unsubgithub) script that will set notifications to
  ignored for every repo in an organization.  Really useful for a
  class with hundreds of repos that you want to ignore.  Next
  improvement will be to add a regexp as a switch to only repo names
  matching the regex will be ignored.
